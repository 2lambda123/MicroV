# =====================================================================
# Example PVH Linux guest configuration
# =====================================================================
#
# This is a fairly minimal example of what is required for a
# PVH Linux guest. For a more complete guide see xl.cfg(5)

# This configures a PVH rather than PV guest
type = "pvh"

# Guest name
name = "vpnvm"

# 128-bit UUID for the domain as a hexadecimal number.
# Use "uuidgen" to generate one if required.
# The default behavior is to generate a new UUID each time the guest is started.
#uuid = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Kernel image to boot
kernel = "/boot/vpnvm-vmlinux"

# Ramdisk (optional)
ramdisk = "/boot/vpnvm-rootfs.cpio.gz"

# Kernel command line options
#extra = "root=/dev/xvda1"

# Initial memory allocation (MB)
memory = 170

# Number of VCPUS
vcpus = 1

# Network devices
# A list of 'vifspec' entries as described in
# docs/misc/xl-network-configuration.markdown
#vif = [ 'type=vif' ]

# Disk Devices
# A list of `diskspec' entries as described in
# docs/misc/xl-disk-configuration.txt
# disk = [ '/dev/zvol/tank/guest-volume,raw,xvda,rw' ]
